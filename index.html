      This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a heterogeneous
      classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared
      to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets.
      We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive
      active learning and traditional machine learning approaches. Our results show that...We conclude that...

  <p class="ex1">
     Climate change is an natural phenomenon and it was always bound to happen, even if humans never set foot on earth,
     however the rate of global warming due to climate change has never been as high as it is today compared to
     pre-industrial periods. As humans, we have a role of protecting ourselves and our environment, however as the rates 
     of climate change doesn’t seem to be decreasing as presented in Figure 1,

we must find a path in order for us to adapt and protect ourselves from the damage we have instigated, this can be 
done through the adaptation of satellite technology.

      The Surface Water and Ocean Topography Mission (SWOT) uses a satellite with the technology capable of measuring the
      sea level, whilst aiming to measure at a degree of accuracy of 1cm(Launch of the International SWOT (Surface Water 
      and Ocean Topography) Mission (Nasa broadcast),2022,18:20), the satellite will cover at least 86% of the globe (of the
      worlds lakes and rivers wider than 100 metres (Wiki, 2023). Scientists will be able to access this information using
      an instrument known as the   . Measuring sea levels

  <h3 id="ActiveVPassive">Types of measurements: Active vs Remote sensing</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
      Remote sensing is a way of gathering information of a point of interest without physically touching it. Satellites can 
      collect data in two fundamental methods, Active or Passive remote sensing. Active remote sensing is where a satellite 
      transmits radiation (usually electromagnetic) to a point of interest, then receives the radiation. Passive remote 
      sensing is where the receiver captures backscattered radiation such as light or infrared reflected or emitted by objects.
      Take a camera for example, cameras capture light reflected of an object then uses this to create an image. An advantage 
      of passive remote sensing would be that it is able to create coloured images, a disadvantage would be that no images would
      be created if there is no radiation to receive, this can happen when its dark. Also, if there are clouds or particulates in 
      the air, the quality of the image would be affected. Active remote sensing allows data to be recorded regardless of the
      daylight or cloud coverage. However, as active remote sensing sends and receives its own radiation, this allows satellites 
      to record data day and night, which is why Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) is commonly used in satellites.
